PyBLP is a Python 3 implementation of routines for estimating the demand for differentiated products with BLP-type random coefficients logit models. This package was created by `Jeff Gortmaker <https://jeffgortmaker.com/>`_ in collaboration with `Chris Conlon <https://chrisconlon.github.io/>`_.

Development of the package has been guided by the work of many researchers and practitioners. For a full list of references, including the original work of `Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) <https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecm/emetrp/v63y1995i4p841-90.html>`_, refer to the `references <https://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/references.html>`_ section of the documentation.


Citation
--------

If you use PyBLP in your research, we ask that you also cite `Conlon and Gortmaker (2020) <https://jeffgortmaker.com/files/Best_Practices_for_Differentiated_Products_Demand_Estimation_with_PyBLP.pdf>`_, which describes the advances implemented in the package.

Installation
------------

The PyBLP package has been tested on `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ versions 3.6 through 3.9. The `SciPy instructions <https://scipy.org/install/>`_ for installing related packages is a good guide for how to install a scientific Python environment. A good choice is the `Anaconda Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_, since it comes packaged with the following PyBLP dependencies: `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_, `SciPy <https://scipy.org/>`_, `SymPy <https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html>`_, and `Patsy <https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. For absorption of high dimension fixed effects, PyBLP also depends on its companion package `PyHDFE <https://github.com/jeffgortmaker/pyhdfe>`_, which will be installed when PyBLP is installed.

However, PyBLP may not work with old versions of its dependencies. You can update PyBLP's Anaconda dependencies with::

    conda update numpy scipy sympy patsy

You can update PyHDFE with::

    pip install --upgrade pyhdfe

You can install the current release of PyBLP with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_::

    pip install pyblp

You can upgrade to a newer release with the ``--upgrade`` flag::

    pip install --upgrade pyblp

If you lack permissions, you can install PyBLP in your user directory with the ``--user`` flag::

    pip install --user pyblp

Alternatively, you can download a wheel or source archive from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pyblp/>`_. You can find the latest development code on `GitHub <https://github.com/jeffgortmaker/pyblp/>`_ and the latest development documentation `here <https://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.


Other Languages
---------------

Once installed, PyBLP can be incorporated into projects written in many other languages with the help of various tools that enable interoperability with Python.

For example, the `reticulate <https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate>`_ package makes interacting with PyBLP in R straightforward (when supported, Python objects can be converted to their R counterparts with the ``py_to_r`` function, which needs to be used manually because we set ``convert=FALSE`` to get rid of errors about trying to automatically convert unsupported objects)::

    library(reticulate)
    pyblp <- import("pyblp", convert=FALSE)
    pyblp$options$flush_output <- TRUE

Similarly, `PyCall <https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl>`_ can be used to incorporate PyBLP into a Julia workflow::

    using PyCall
    pyblp = pyimport("pyblp")

The `py command <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/call-python-libraries.html>`_ serves a similar purpose in MATLAB::

   py.pyblp
