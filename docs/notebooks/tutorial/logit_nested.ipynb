    "\n",
    "A Logit :class:`Problem` can be created by simply excluding the formulation for the nonlinear parameters, $X_2$, along with any agent information. In other words, it requires only specifying the _linear component_ of demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll set up and solve a simple version of the fake data cereal problem from :ref:`references:Nevo (2000)`. Since we won't include any demand-side nonlinear characteristics or parameters, we don't have to worry about configuring an optimization routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some important reserved variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `market_ids` are the unique market identifiers which we subscript with $t$.\n",
    "- `shares` specifies the market shares which need to be between zero and one, and within a market ID, $\\sum_{j} s_{jt} \\leq 1$.\n",
    "- `prices` are prices $p_{jt}$. These have some special properties and are _always_ treated as endogenous.\n",
    "- `demand_instruments0`, `demand_instruments1`, and so on are numbered demand instruments. These represent only the _excluded_ instruments. The exogenous regressors in $X_1$ will be automatically added to the set of instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the product data which at a minimum consists of `market_ids`, `shares`, `prices`, and at least a single column of demand instruments, `demand_instruments0`.\n",
    "2. Define a :class:`Formulation` for the $X_1$ (linear) demand model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This and all other formulas are similar to R and [patsy](https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) formulas.\n",
    "    - It includes a constant by default. To exclude the constant, specify either a `0` or a `-1`.\n",
    "    - To efficiently include fixed effects, use the `absorb` option and specify which categorical variables you would like to absorb.\n",
    "    - Some model reduction may happen automatically. The constant will be excluded if you include fixed effects and some precautions are taken against collinearity. However, you will have to make sure that differently-named variables are not collinear.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Combine the :class:`Formulation` and product data to construct a :class:`Problem`.\n",
    "4. Use :meth:`Problem.solve` to estimate paramters."

    "Now, we require that $\\epsilon_{jti} = \\bar{\\epsilon}_{h(j)ti} + (1 - \\rho) \\bar{\\epsilon}_{jti}$ is distributed IID with the Type I Extreme Value (Gumbel) distribution. As $\\rho \\rightarrow 1$, all consumers stay within their group. As $\\rho \\rightarrow 0$, this collapses to the IIA logit. Note that if we wanted, we could allow $\\rho$ to differ between groups with the notation $\\rho_{h(j)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us aggregate market shares as the product of two logits, the within group logit and the across group logit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_{jt} = \\frac{\\exp[V_{jt} / (1 - \\rho)]}{\\exp[V_{h(j)t} / (1 - \\rho)]}\\cdot\\frac{\\exp V_{h(j)t}}{1 + \\sum_h \\exp V_{ht}},$$\n",

    "where $s_{j|h(j)t} = s_{jt} / s_{h(j)t}$ and $s_{h(j)t}$ is the share of group $h$ in market $t$. See :ref:`references:Berry (1994)` or :ref:`references:Cardell (1997)` for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the left hand side is data, though the $\\ln s_{j|h(j)t}$ is clearly endogenous which means we must instrument for it. Rather than include $\\ln s_{j|h(j)t}$ along with the linear components of utility, $X_1$, whenever `nesting_ids` are included in `product_data`, $\\rho$ is treated as a nonlinear $X_2$ parameter.

However, in this example because the number of products per nest does not vary across markets, if we include product fixed effects, this instrument is irrelevant.\n",
