    r"""Results of optimal instrument computation.

    The :meth:`OptimalInstrumentResults.to_problem` method can be used to update the original :class:`Problem` with
    the computed optimal instruments.

    Attributes
    ----------
    problem_results : `ProblemResults`
        :class:`ProblemResults` that was used to compute these optimal instrument results.
    demand_instruments : `ndarray`
        Estimated optimal demand-side instruments for :math:`\theta`, denoted :math:`Z_D^\text{opt}`.
    supply_instruments : `ndarray`
        Estimated optimal supply-side instruments for :math:`\theta`, denoted :math:`Z_S^\text{opt}`.
    supply_shifter_formulation : `Formulation or None`
        :class:`Formulation` configuration for supply shifters that will by default be included in the full set of
        optimal demand-side instruments. This is only constructed if a supply side was estimated, and it can be changed
        in :meth:`OptimalInstrumentResults.to_problem`. By default, this is the formulation for :math:`X_3^\text{ex}`
        from :class:`Problem` excluding any variables in the formulation for :math:`X_1^\text{ex}`.
    demand_shifter_formulation : `Formulation or None`
        :class:`Formulation` configuration for demand shifters that will by default be included in the full set of
        optimal supply-side instruments. This is only constructed if a supply side was estimated, and it can be changed
        in :meth:`OptimalInstrumentResults.to_problem`. By default, this is the formulation for :math:`X_1^\text{ex}`
        from :class:`Problem` excluding any variables in the formulation for :math:`X_3^\text{ex}`.
    inverse_covariance_matrix : `ndarray`
        Inverse of the sample covariance matrix of the estimated :math:`\xi` and :math:`\omega`, which is used to
        normalize the expected Jacobians. If a supply side was not estimated, this is simply the sample estimate of
        :math:`1 / \sigma_{\xi}^2`.
    expected_xi_by_theta_jacobian : `ndarray`
        Estimated :math:`E[\frac{\partial\xi}{\partial\theta} \mid Z]`.

        Estimated :math:`E[\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial\theta} \mid Z]`.
    expected_prices : `ndarray`
        Vector of expected prices conditional on all exogenous variables, :math:`E[p \mid Z]`, which may have been
        specified in :meth:`ProblemResults.compute_optimal_instruments`.
    expected_shares : `ndarray`
        Vector of expected market shares conditional on all exogenous variables, :math:`E[s \mid Z]`.
    computation_time : `float`
        Number of seconds it took to compute optimal excluded instruments.
    draws : `int`
        Number of draws used to approximate the integral over the error term density.

        Flags for convergence of the iteration routine used to compute equilibrium prices in each market. Rows are in
        the same order as :attr:`Problem.unique_market_ids` and column indices correspond to draws.
    fp_iterations : `ndarray`
        Number of major iterations completed by the iteration routine used to compute equilibrium prices in each market
        for each error term draw. Rows are in the same order as :attr:`Problem.unique_market_ids` and column indices
        correspond to draws.
    contraction_evaluations : `ndarray`
        Number of times the contraction used to compute equilibrium prices was evaluated in each market for each error
        term draw. Rows are in the same order as :attr:`Problem.unique_market_ids` and column indices correspond to
        draws.

        The re-created problem will be exactly the same, except that instruments will be replaced with estimated
        feasible optimal instruments.

        .. note::

           Most of the explanation here is only important if a supply side was estimated.

        The optimal excluded demand-side instruments consist of the following:

            1. Estimated optimal demand-side instruments for :math:`\theta`, :math:`Z_D^\text{opt}`, excluding columns
               of instruments for any parameters on exogenous linear characteristics that were not concentrated out, but
               rather included in :math:`\theta` by :meth:`Problem.solve`.

            2. Optimal instruments for any linear demand-side parameters on endogenous product characteristics,
               :math:`\alpha`, which were concentrated out and hence not included in :math:`\theta`. These optimal
               instruments are simply an integral of the endogenous product characteristics, :math:`X_1^\text{en}`, over
               the joint density of :math:`\xi` and :math:`\omega`. It is only possible to concentrate out
               :math:`\alpha` when there isn't a supply side, so the approximation of these optimal instruments is
               simply :math:`X_1^\text{en}` evaluated at the constant vector of expected prices, :math:`E[p \mid Z]`,
               specified in :meth:`ProblemResults.compute_optimal_instruments`.

            3. If a supply side was estimated, any supply shifters, which are by default formulated by
               :attr:`OptimalInstrumentResults.supply_shifter_formulation`: all characteristics in :math:`X_3^\text{ex}`
               not in :math:`X_1^\text{ex}`.

        Similarly, if a supply side was estimated, the optimal excluded supply-side instruments consist of the
        following:

            1. Estimated optimal supply-side instruments for :math:`\theta`, :math:`Z_S^\text{opt}`, excluding columns
               of instruments for any parameters on exogenous linear characteristics that were not concentrated out, but
               rather included in :math:`\theta` by :meth:`Problem.solve`.

            2. Optimal instruments for any linear supply-side parameters on endogenous product characteristics,
               :math:`\gamma^\text{en}`, which were concentrated out an hence not included in :math:`\theta`. This
               is only relevant if ``shares`` were included in the formulation for :math:`X_3` in :class:`Problem`.
               The corresponding optimal instruments are simply an integral of the endogenous product characteristics,
               :math:`X_3^\text{en}`, over the joint density of :math:`\xi` and :math:`\omega`. The approximation of
               these optimal instruments is simply :math:`X_3^\text{en}` evaluated at the market shares that arise under
               the constant vector of expected prices, :math:`E[p \mid Z]`, specified in
               :meth:`ProblemResults.compute_optimal_instruments`.

            2. If a supply side was estimated, any demand shifters, which are by default formulated by
               :attr:`OptimalInstrumentResults.demand_shifter_formulation`: all characteristics in :math:`X_1^\text{ex}`
               not in :math:`X_3^\text{ex}`.

        As usual, the excluded demand-side instruments will be supplemented with :math:`X_1^\text{ex}` and the excluded
        supply-side instruments will be supplemented with :math:`X_3^\text{ex}`. The same fixed effects configured in
        :class:`Problem` will be absorbed.

        .. warning::

           If a supply side was estimated, the addition of supply- and demand-shifters may create collinearity issues.
           Make sure to check that shifters and other product characteristics are not collinear.

        Parameters
        ----------
        supply_shifter_formulation : `Formulation, optional`
            :class:`Formulation` configuration for supply shifters to be included in the set of optimal demand-side
            instruments. This is only used if a supply side was estimated. Intercepts will be ignored. By default,
            :attr:`OptimalInstrumentResults.supply_shifter_formulation` is used.
        demand_shifter_formulation : `Formulation, optional`
            :class:`Formulation` configuration for demand shifters to be included in the set of optimal supply-side
            instruments. This is only used if a supply side was estimated. Intercepts will be ignored. By default,
            :attr:`OptimalInstrumentResults.demand_shifter_formulation` is used.
        product_data : `structured array-like, optional`
            Product data used instead of what was saved from ``product_data`` when initializing the original
            :class:`Problem`. This may need to be specified if either the supply or demand shifter formulation contains
            some term that was not stored into memory, such as a categorical variable or a mathematical expression.
        drop_indices : `sequence of int, optional`
            Which column indices to drop from :attr:`OptimalInstrumentResults.demand_instruments` and
            :attr:`OptimalInstrumentResults.supply_instruments`. By default, the only columns dropped are those that
            correspond to parameters in :math:`\theta` on exogenous linear characteristics.

        Returns
        -------
        `OptimalInstrumentProblem`
            :class:`OptimalInstrumentProblem`, which is a :class:`Problem` updated to use the estimated optimal
            instruments.
