        r"""Solve the problem.

        The problem is solved in one or more GMM steps. During each step, any parameters in :math:`\theta` are optimized
        to minimize the GMM objective value, giving the estimated :math:`\hat{\theta}`. If there are no parameters in
        :math:`\theta` (for example, in the logit model there are no nonlinear parameters and all linear parameters can
        be concentrated out), the objective is evaluated once during the step.

        If there are nonlinear parameters, the mean utility, :math:`\delta(\theta)` is computed market-by-market with
        fixed point iteration. Otherwise, it is computed analytically according to the solution of the logit model. If a
        supply side is to be estimated, marginal costs, :math:`c(\theta)`, are also computed market-by-market. Linear
        parameters are then estimated, which are used to recover structural error terms, which in turn are used to form
        the objective value. By default, the objective gradient is computed as well.

        .. note::

           This method supports :func:`parallel` processing. If multiprocessing is used, market-by-market computation of
           :math:`\delta(\theta)` (and :math:`\tilde{c}(\theta)` if a supply side is estimated), along with associated
           Jacobians, will be distributed among the processes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sigma : `array-like, optional`
            Configuration for which elements in the lower-triangular Cholesky root of the covariance matrix for
            unobserved taste heterogeneity, :math:`\Sigma`, are fixed at zero and starting values for the other
            elements, which, if not fixed by ``sigma_bounds``, are in the vector of unknown elements, :math:`\theta`.

            Rows and columns correspond to columns in :math:`X_2`, which is formulated according
            ``product_formulations`` in :class:`Problem`. If :math:`X_2` was not formulated, this should not be
            specified, since the logit model will be estimated.

            Values above the diagonal are ignored. Zeros are assumed to be zero throughout estimation and nonzeros are,
            if not fixed by ``sigma_bounds``, starting values for unknown elements in :math:`\theta`. If any columns are
            fixed at zero, only the first few columns of integration nodes (specified in :class:`Problem`) will be used.

            To have nonzero covariances for only a subset of the random coefficients, the characteristics for those
            random coefficients with zero covariances should come first in :math:`X_2`. This can be seen by looking at
            the expression for :math:`\Sigma\Sigma'`, the actual covariance matrix of the random coefficients.

        pi : `array-like, optional`
            Configuration for which elements in the matrix of parameters that measures how agent tastes vary with
            demographics, :math:`\Pi`, are fixed at zero and starting values for the other elements, which, if not fixed
            by ``pi_bounds``, are in the vector of unknown elements, :math:`\theta`.

            Rows correspond to the same product characteristics as in ``sigma``. Columns correspond to columns in
            :math:`d`, which is formulated according to ``agent_formulation`` in :class:`Problem`. If :math:`d` was not
            formulated, this should not be specified.

            Zeros are assumed to be zero throughout estimation and nonzeros are, if not fixed by ``pi_bounds``, starting
            values for unknown elements in :math:`\theta`.

        rho : `array-like, optional`
            Configuration for which elements in the vector of parameters that measure within nesting group correlation,
            :math:`\rho`, are fixed at zero and starting values for the other elements, which, if not fixed by
            ``rho_bounds``, are in the vector of unknown elements, :math:`\theta`.

            If this is a scalar, it corresponds to all groups defined by the ``nesting_ids`` field of ``product_data``
            in :class:`Problem`. If this is a vector, it must have :math:`H` elements, one for each nesting group.
            Elements correspond to group IDs in the sorted order of :attr:`Problem.unique_nesting_ids`. If nesting IDs
            were not specified, this should not be specified either.

            Zeros are assumed to be zero throughout estimation and nonzeros are, if not fixed by ``rho_bounds``,
            starting values for unknown elements in :math:`\theta`.

        phi : `array-like, optional`
            Configuration for which elements in the vector of parameters that measure unobservable autocorrelation,
            :math:`\phi`, are fixed at zero and starting values for the other elements, which, if not fixed by
            ``phi_bounds``, are in the vector of unknown elements, :math;`\theta`.

            If ``lag_indices`` in ``product_data`` were specified, this is either a scalar :math:`\phi = \phi_\xi`
            or, if a supply side was specified, a two-element vector :math:`\phi = [\phi_\xi, \phi_\omega]'`,
            corresponding to demand- and supply-side unobservable autocorrelations:

            .. math::
               :eq: ar1

               \xi_{jt} = \phi_\xi \cdot L \xi_{jt} + \Delta_{\phi_\xi} \xi_{jt},
               \omega_{jt} = \phi_\omega \cdot L \omega_{jt} + \Delta_{\phi_\omega} \omega_{jt},

            where the ``lag_indices`` field in ``product_data`` defines the lag operator :math:`L`.

        beta: `array-like, optional`
            Configuration for which elements in the vector of demand-side linear parameters, :math:`\beta`, are
            concentrated out of the problem. Usually, this is left unspecified, unless there is a supply side, in which
            case parameters on endogenous product characteristics cannot be concentrated out of the problem. Values
            specify which elements are fixed at zero and starting values for the other elements, which, if not fixed by
            ``beta_bounds``, are in the vector of unknown elements, :math:`\theta`.

            Elements correspond to columns in :math:`X_1`, which is formulated according to ``product_formulations`` in
            :class:`Problem`.

            Both ``None`` and ``numpy.nan`` indicate that the parameter should be concentrated out of the problem. That
            is, it will be estimated, but does not have to be included in :math:`\theta`. Zeros are assumed to be zero
            throughout estimation and nonzeros are, if not fixed by ``beta_bounds``, starting values for unknown
            elements in :math:`\theta`.

        gamma: `array-like, optional`
            Configuration for which elements in the vector of supply-side linear parameters, :math:`\gamma`, are
            concentrated out of the problem. Usually, this is left unspecified. Values specify which elements are fixed
            at zero and starting values for the other elements, which, if not fixed by ``gamma_bounds``, are in the
            vector of unknown elements, :math:`\theta`.

            Elements correspond to columns in :math:`X_3`, which is formulated according to ``product_formulations`` in
            :class:`Problem`. If :math:`X_3` was not formulated, this should not be specified.

            Both ``None`` and ``numpy.nan`` indicate that the parameter should be concentrated out of the problem. That
            is, it will be estimated, but does not have to be included in :math:`\theta`. Zeros are assumed to be zero
            throughout estimation and nonzeros are, if not fixed by ``gamma_bounds``, starting values for unknown
            elements in :math:`\theta`.

        sigma_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`\Sigma` bounds of the form ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and ``ub`` are of the
            same size as ``sigma``. Each element in ``lb`` and ``ub`` determines the lower and upper bound for its
            counterpart in ``sigma``. If ``optimization`` does not support bounds, these will be ignored. If bounds are
            supported, the diagonal of ``sigma`` is by default bounded from below by zero.

            Values above the diagonal are ignored. Lower and upper bounds corresponding to zeros in ``sigma`` are set to
            zero. Setting a lower bound equal to an upper bound fixes the corresponding element, removing it from
            :math:`\theta`. Both ``None`` and ``numpy.nan`` are converted to ``-numpy.inf`` in ``lb`` and to
            ``numpy.inf`` in ``ub``.

        pi_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`\Pi` bounds of the form ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and ``ub`` are of the
            same size as ``pi``. Each element in ``lb`` and ``ub`` determines the lower and upper bound for its
            counterpart in ``pi``. If ``optimization`` does not support bounds, these will be ignored. By default,
            ``pi`` is unbounded.

            Lower and upper bounds corresponding to zeros in ``pi`` are set to zero. Setting a lower bound equal to an
            upper bound fixes the corresponding element, removing it from :math:`\theta`. Both ``None`` and
            ``numpy.nan`` are converted to ``-numpy.inf`` in ``lb`` and to ``numpy.inf`` in ``ub``.

        rho_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`\rho` bounds of the form ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and ``ub`` are of the
            same size as ``rho``. Each element in ``lb`` and ``ub`` determines the lower and upper bound for its
            counterpart in ``rho``. If ``optimization`` does not support bounds, these will be ignored.

            If bounds are supported, ``rho`` is by default bounded from below by ``0``, which corresponds to the simple
            logit model, and bounded from above by ``0.99`` because values greater than ``1`` are inconsistent with
            utility maximization.

            Lower and upper bounds corresponding to zeros in ``rho`` are set to zero. Setting a lower bound equal to an
            upper bound fixes the corresponding element, removing it from :math:`\theta`. Both ``None`` and
            ``numpy.nan`` are converted to ``-numpy.inf`` in ``lb`` and to ``numpy.inf`` in ``ub``.

        phi_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`\phi` bounds of the form ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and ``ub`` are of the
            same size as ``phi``. If ``optimization`` does not support bounds, these will be ignored.

            Setting a lower bound equal to an upper bound fixes this parameter, removing it from :math:`\theta`. Both
            ``None`` and ``numpy.nan`` are converted to ``-numpy.inf`` in ``lb`` and to ``numpy.inf`` in ``ub``.

        beta_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`\beta` bounds of the form ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and ``ub`` are of the
            same size as ``beta``. Each element in ``lb`` and ``ub`` determines the lower and upper bound for its
            counterpart in ``beta``. If ``optimization`` does not support bounds, these will be ignored.

            Usually, this is left unspecified unless there is a supply side, in which case parameters on endogenous
            product characteristics cannot be concentrated out of the problem. It is generally a good idea to constrain
            such parameters to be nonzero so that the intra-firm Jacobian of shares with respect to prices does not
            become singular.

            By default, all non-concentrated out parameters are unbounded. Bounds should only be specified for
            parameters that are included in :math:`\theta`; that is, those with initial values specified in ``beta``.

            Lower and upper bounds corresponding to zeros in ``beta`` are set to zero. Setting a lower bound equal to an
            upper bound fixes the corresponding element, removing it from :math:`\theta`. Both ``None`` and
            ``numpy.nan`` are converted to ``-numpy.inf`` in ``lb`` and to ``numpy.inf`` in ``ub``.

        gamma_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`\gamma` bounds of the form ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and ``ub`` are of the
            same size as ``gamma``. Each element in ``lb`` and ``ub`` determines the lower and upper bound for its
            counterpart in ``gamma``. If ``optimization`` does not support bounds, these will be ignored.

            By default, all non-concentrated out parameters are unbounded. Bounds should only be specified for
            parameters that are included in :math:`\theta`; that is, those with initial values specified in ``gamma``.

            Lower and upper bounds corresponding to zeros in ``gamma`` are set to zero. Setting a lower bound equal to
            an upper bound fixes the corresponding element, removing it from :math:`\theta`. Both ``None`` and
            ``numpy.nan`` are converted to ``-numpy.inf`` in ``lb`` and to ``numpy.inf`` in ``ub``.

        delta : `array-like, optional`
            Initial values for the mean utility, :math:`\delta`. If there are any nonlinear parameters, these are the
            values at which the fixed point iteration routine will start during the first objective evaluation. By
            default, the solution to the logit model in :eq:`logit_delta` is used. If :math:`\rho` is specified, the
            solution to the nested logit model in :eq:`nested_logit_delta` under the initial ``rho`` is used instead.
        method : `str, optional`
            The estimation routine that will be used. The following methods are supported:

                - ``'1s'`` - One-step GMM.

                - ``'2s'`` (default) - Two-step GMM.

            Iterated GMM can be manually implemented by executing single GMM steps in a loop, in which after the first
            iteration, nonlinear parameters and weighting matrices from the last :class:`ProblemResults` are passed as
            arguments.

        initial_update : `bool, optional`
            Whether to update starting values for the mean utility :math:`\delta` and the weighting matrix :math:`W` at
            the initial parameter values before the first GMM step. This initial update will be called a zeroth step.

            By default, an initial update will not be used unless ``micro_moments`` are specified without an initial
            weighting matrix ``W``.

            .. note::

               When trying multiple parameter starting values to verify that the optimization routine converges to the
               same optimum, using ``initial_update`` is not recommended because different weighting matrices will be
               used for these different runs. A better option is to use ``optimization=Optimization('return')`` at the
               best guess for parameter values and pass :attr:`ProblemResults.updated_W` to ``W`` for each set of
               different parameter starting values.

        optimization : `Optimization, optional`
            :class:`Optimization` configuration for how to solve the optimization problem in each GMM step, which is
            only used if there are unfixed nonlinear parameters over which to optimize. By default,
            ``Optimization('l-bfgs-b', {'ftol': 0, 'gtol': 1e-8})`` is used. If available, ``Optimization('knitro')``
            may be preferable. Generally, it is recommended to consider a number of different optimization routines and
            starting values, verifying that :math:`\hat{\theta}` satisfies both the first and second order conditions.
            Choosing a routine that supports bounds (and configuring bounds) is typically a good idea. Choosing a
            routine that does not use analytic gradients will often down estimation.
        scale_objective : `bool, optional`
            Whether to scale the objective in :eq:`objective` by :math:`N`, the number of observations, in which case
            the objective after two GMM steps is equal to the :math:`J` statistic from :ref:`references:Hansen (1982)`.
            By default, the objective is scaled by :math:`N`.

            In theory the scale of the objective should not matter, but in practice having similar objective values for
            different problem sizes is helpful because similar optimization tolerances can be used.

        check_optimality : `str, optional`
            How to check for optimality (first and second order conditions) after the optimization routine finishes.
            The following configurations are supported:

                - ``'gradient'`` - Analytically compute the gradient after optimization finishes, but do not compute the
                  Hessian. Since Jacobians needed to compute standard errors will already be computed, gradient
                  computation will not take a long time. This option may be useful if Hessian computation takes a long
                  time when, for example, there are a large number of parameters.

                - ``'both'`` (default) - Also compute the Hessian with central finite differences after optimization
                  finishes.

        finite_differences : `bool, optional`
            Whether to use finite differences to compute Jacobians and the gradient instead of analytic expressions.
            Since finite differences comes with numerical approximation error and is typically slower, analytic
            expressions are used by default.

            One situation in which finite differences may be preferable is when there are a sufficiently large number of
            products and integration nodes in individual markets to make computing analytic Jacobians infeasible because
            of memory requirements. Note that an analytic expression for the Hessian has not been implemented, so when
            computed it is always approximated with finite differences.

        error_behavior : `str, optional`
            How to handle any errors. For example, there can sometimes be overflow or underflow when computing
            :math:`\delta(\theta)` at a large :math:`\hat{\theta}`. The following behaviors are supported:

                - ``'revert'`` (default) - Revert problematic values to their last computed values. If there are
                  problematic values during the first objective evaluation, revert values in :math:`\delta(\theta)` to
                  their starting values; in :math:`\tilde{c}(\hat{\theta})`, to prices; in the objective, to ``1e10``;
                  and in other matrices such as Jacobians, to zeros.

                - ``'punish'`` - Set the objective to ``1`` and its gradient to all zeros. This option along with a
                  large ``error_punishment`` can be helpful for routines that do not use analytic gradients.

                - ``'raise'`` - Raise an exception.

        error_punishment : `float, optional`
            How to scale the GMM objective value after an error. By default, the objective value is not scaled.
        delta_behavior : `str, optional`
            Configuration for the values at which the fixed point computation of :math:`\delta(\theta)` in each market
            will start. This configuration is only relevant if there are unfixed nonlinear parameters over which to
            optimize. The following behaviors are supported:

                - ``'first'`` (default) - Start at the values configured by ``delta`` during the first GMM step, and at
                  the values computed by the last GMM step for each subsequent step.

                - ``'logit'`` - Start at the solution to the logit model in :eq:`logit_delta`, or if :math:`\rho` is
                  specified, the solution to the nested logit model in :eq:`nested_logit_delta`. If the initial
                  ``delta`` is left unspecified and there is no nesting parameter being optimized over, this will
                  generally be equivalent to ``'first'``.

                - ``'last'`` - Start at the values of :math:`\delta(\theta)` computed during the last objective
                  evaluation, or, if this is the first evaluation, at the values configured by ``delta``. This behavior
                  tends to speed up computation but may introduce some instability into estimation.

        iteration : `Iteration, optional`
            :class:`Iteration` configuration for how to solve the fixed point problem used to compute
            :math:`\delta(\theta)` in each market. This configuration is only relevant if there are nonlinear
            parameters, since :math:`\delta` can be estimated analytically in the logit model. By default,
            ``Iteration('squarem', {'atol': 1e-14})`` is used. Newton-based routines such as ``Iteration('lm'`)`` that
            compute the Jacobian can often be faster (especially when there are nesting parameters), but the
            Jacobian-free SQUAREM routine is used by default because it speed is often comparable and in practice it can
            be slightly more stable.
        fp_type : `str, optional`
            Configuration for the type of contraction mapping used to compute :math:`\delta(\theta)`. The following
            types are supported:

                - ``'safe_linear'`` (default) - The standard linear contraction mapping in :eq:`contraction` (or
                  :eq:`nested_contraction` when there is nesting) with safeguards against numerical overflow.
                  Specifically, :math:`\max_j V_{ijt}` (or :math:`\max_j V_{ijt} / (1 - \rho_{h(j)})` when there is
                  nesting) is subtracted from :math:`V_{ijt}` and the logit expression for choice probabilities in
                  :eq:`probabilities` (or :eq:`nested_probabilities`) is re-scaled accordingly. Such re-scaling is known
                  as the log-sum-exp trick.

                - ``'linear'`` - The standard linear contraction mapping without safeguards against numerical overflow.
                  This option may be preferable to ``'safe_linear'`` if utilities are reasonably small and unlikely to
                  create overflow problems.

                - ``'nonlinear'`` - Iteration over :math:`\exp \delta_{jt}` instead of :math:`\delta_{jt}`. This can be
                  faster than ``'linear'`` because it involves fewer logarithms. Also, following
                  :ref:`references:Brunner, Heiss, Romahn, and Weiser (2017)`, the :math:`\exp \delta_{jt}` term can be
                  cancelled out of the expression because it also appears in the numerator of :eq:`probabilities` in the
                  definition of :math:`s_{jt}(\delta, \theta)`. This second trick only works when there are no
                  nesting parameters.

                - ``'safe_nonlinear'`` - Exponentiated version with minimal safeguards against numerical overflow.
                  Specifically, :math:`\max_j \mu_{ijt}` is subtracted from :math:`\mu_{ijt}`. This helps with stability
                  but is less helpful than subtracting from the full :math:`V_{ijt}`, so this version is less stable
                  than ``'safe_linear'``.

            This option is only relevant if ``sigma`` or ``pi`` are specified because :math:`\delta` can be estimated
            analytically in the logit model with :eq:`logit_delta` and in the nested logit model with
            :eq:`nested_logit_delta`.

        shares_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`s_{jt}(\delta, \theta)` bounds in the contraction in :eq:`contraction` of the form
            ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and ``ub`` are floats or ``None``. By default, simulated shares are
            bounded from below by ``1e-300``. This is only relevant if ``fp_type`` is ``'safe_linear'`` or ``'linear'``.
            Bounding shares in the contraction does nothing with a nonlinear fixed point.

            It can be particularly helpful to bound shares in the contraction from below by a small number to prevent
            the contraction from failing when there are issues with zero or negative simulated shares. Zero shares can
            occur when there are underflow issues and negative shares can occur when there are issues with the numerical
            integration routine having negative integration weights (e.g., for sparse grid integration).

            The idea is that a small lower bound will allow the contraction to converge even when it encounters some
            issues with small or negative shares. However, if these issues are unlikely, disabling this behavior can
            speed up the iteration routine because fewer checks will be done.

            Both ``None`` and ``numpy.nan`` are converted to ``-numpy.inf`` in ``lb`` and to ``numpy.inf`` in ``ub``.

        costs_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`c_{jt}(\theta)` bounds of the form ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and ``ub``
            are floats or ``None``. This is only relevant if :math:`X_3` was formulated by ``product_formulations`` in
            :class:`Problem`. By default, marginal costs are unbounded.

            When ``costs_type`` in :class:`Problem` is ``'log'``, nonpositive :math:`c(\theta)` values can create
            problems when computing :math:`\tilde{c}(\theta) = \log c(\theta)`. One solution is to set ``lb`` to a small
            number. Rows in Jacobians associated with clipped marginal costs will be zero.

            Both ``None`` and ``numpy.nan`` are converted to ``-numpy.inf`` in ``lb`` and to ``numpy.inf`` in ``ub``.

        W : `array-like, optional`
            Starting values for the weighting matrix, :math:`W`. By default, the 2SLS weighting matrix in :eq:`2sls_W`
            is used, unless there are any ``micro_moments``, in which case an ``initial_update`` will be used to update
            starting values :math:`W` and the mean utility :math:`\delta` at the initial parameter values before the
            first GMM step.
        center_moments : `bool, optional`
            Whether to center each column of the demand- and supply-side moments :math:`g` before updating the weighting
            matrix :math:`W` according to :eq:`W`. By default, the moments are centered. This has no effect if
            ``W_type`` is ``'unadjusted'``.
        W_type : `str, optional`
            How to update the weighting matrix. This has no effect if ``method`` is ``'1s'``. Usually, ``se_type``
            should be the same. The following types are supported:

                - ``'robust'`` (default) - Heteroscedasticity robust weighting matrix defined in :eq:`W` and
                  :eq:`robust_S`.

                - ``'clustered'`` - Clustered weighting matrix defined in :eq:`W` and :eq:`clustered_S`. Clusters must
                  be defined by the ``clustering_ids`` field of ``product_data`` in :class:`Problem`.

                - ``'unadjusted'`` - Homoskedastic weighting matrix defined in :eq:`W` and :eq:`unadjusted_S`.

            This only affects the standard demand- and supply-side block of the updated weighting matrix. If there are
            micro moments, this matrix will be block-diagonal with a micro moment block equal to the inverse of the
            scaled covariance matrix defined in :eq:`scaled_micro_moment_covariances`.

        se_type : `str, optional`
            How to compute parameter covariances and standard errors. Usually, ``W_type`` should be the same. The
            following types are supported:

                - ``'robust'`` (default) - Heteroscedasticity robust covariances defined in :eq:`covariances` and
                  :eq:`robust_S`.

                - ``'clustered'`` - Clustered covariances defined in :eq:`covariances` and :eq:`clustered_S`. Clusters
                  must be defined by the ``clustering_ids`` field of ``product_data`` in :class:`Problem`.

                - ``'unadjusted'`` - Homoskedastic covariances defined in :eq:`unadjusted_covariances`, which are
                  computed under the assumption that the weighting matrix is optimal.

            This only affects the standard demand- and supply-side block of the matrix of averaged moment covariances.
            If there are micro moments, the :math:`S` matrix defined in the expressions referenced above will be
            block-diagonal with a micro moment block equal to the scaled covariance matrix defined in
            :eq:`scaled_micro_moment_covariances`.

        demand_moment_types : `str or sequence of str, optional`
            This can be used to replace demand-side moments :math:`\bar{g}_D`. The following types are supported:

                - ``'levels'`` (default) - Standard moments in :eq:`moments`:
                  :math:`g_{D,jt} = \xi_{jt} \cdot Z_{D,jt}`.

                - ``'innovations'`` - Replace unobservables with their AR(1) innovations in :eq:`ar1`:
                  :math:`g_{D,jt} = \Delta_{\phi_\xi} \xi_{jt} \cdot Z_{D,jt}`.

                - ``'differenced_innovations'`` - Further difference the innovations in :eq:`ar1` to eliminate, for
                  example, any product-market fixed effects:
                  :math:`g_{D,jt} = \Delta\Delta_{\phi_\xi} \xi_{jt} \cdot Z_{D,jt}`.

            Specifying a list instead of a single type will replace :math:`\bar{g}_D` with a
            corresponding stack, with columns of :math:`Z_D` split according to the number of types. For example, to
            implement :ref:`references:Arellano and Bond(1991)`'s "system GMM" estimator, one can specify
            ``demand_moment_types=['innovations', 'differenced_innovations']`` and provide additional columns in
            :math:`Z_D`, giving

            .. math::

               g_{D,jt} =
               \begin{bmatrix}
                   \Delta_{\phi_\xi} \xi_{jt} \cdot Z_{D,jt,1:M_D / 2} \\
                   \Delta\Delta_{\phi_\xi} \xi_{jt} \cdot Z_{D,jt,M_D / 2 + 1:M_D}
               \end{bmatrix}
               .

            .. warning::

                 Alternative moment types are still an experimental feature. The way in which they are implemented
                 and used may change somewhat in future releases.

        supply_moment_types : `str or sequence of str, optional`
            This can be used to replace supply-side moments :math:`\bar{g}_S` analogously to how ``demand_moment_types``
            replaces demand-side moments, but with :math:`\xi` replaced by :math:`\omega`, :math:`\phi_\xi` replaced by
            :math:`\phi_\omega`, and :math:`Z_D` replaced by :math:`Z_S`.
        covariance_moments_mean : `float, optional`
            If ``covariance_instruments`` were specified in ``product_data``, this can be used to choose a
            :math:`m \neq 0` in covariance moments :math:`E[g_{C,jt}] = E[(\xi_{jt}\omega_{jt} - m)Z_{C,jt}] = 0` where
            :math:`m` is by default zero. This can be used for sensitivity testing to see how different covariances
            may affect estimates.
        micro_moments : `sequence of MicroMoment, optional`
            Configurations for the :math:`M_M` :class:`MicroMoment` instances that will be added to the standard set of
            moments. By default, no micro moments are used, so :math:`M_M = 0`.

            When micro moments are specified, unless an initial weighting matrix ``W`` is specified as well (with a
            lower right micro moment block that reflects micro moment covariances), an ``initial_update`` will be used
            to update starting values :math:`W` and the mean utility :math:`\delta` at the initial parameter values
            before the first GMM step.

            .. note::

               When trying multiple parameter starting values to verify that the optimization routine converges to the
               same optimum, using ``initial_update`` is not recommended because different weighting matrices will be
               used for these different runs. A better option is to use ``optimization=Optimization('return')`` at the
               best guess for parameter values and pass :attr:`ProblemResults.updated_W` to ``W`` for each set of
               different parameter starting values.

        micro_sample_covariances : `array-like, optional`
            Sample covariance matrix for the :math:`M_M` micro moments. By default, their asymptotic covariance matrix
            is computed according to :eq:`scaled_micro_moment_covariances`. This override could be used, for example, if
            instead of estimating covariances at some estimated :math:`\hat{\theta}`, one wanted to use a boostrap
            procedure to compute their covariances directly from the micro data.

        resample_agent_data : `callable, optional`
            If specified, simulation error in moment covariances will be accounted for by resampling
            :math:`r = 1, \dots, R` sets of agents by iteratively calling this function, which should be of the
            following form::

                resample_agent_data(index) --> agent_data or None

            where ``index`` increments from ``0`` to ``1`` and so on and ``agent_data`` is the corresponding resampled
            agent data, which should be a resampled version of the ``agent_data`` passed to :class:`Problem`. Each
            ``index`` should correspond to a different set of randomly drawn agent data, with different integration
            nodes and demographics. If ``index`` is larger than :math:`R - 1`, this function should return ``None``,
            at which point agents will stop being resampled.

class Problem(ProblemEconomy):
    r"""A BLP-type problem.

    This class is initialized with relevant data and solved with :meth:`Problem.solve`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    product_formulations : `Formulation or sequence of Formulation`
        :class:`Formulation` configuration or a sequence of up to three :class:`Formulation` configurations for the
        matrix of demand-side linear product characteristics, :math:`X_1`, for the matrix of demand-side nonlinear
        product characteristics, :math:`X_2`, and for the matrix of supply-side characteristics, :math:`X_3`,
        respectively. If the formulation for :math:`X_3` is not specified or is ``None``, a supply side will not be
        estimated. Similarly, if the formulation for :math:`X_2` is not specified or is ``None``, the logit (or nested
        logit) model will be estimated.

        Variable names should correspond to fields in ``product_data``. The ``shares`` variable should not be included
        in the formulations for :math:`X_1` or :math:`X_2`. The formulation for :math:`X_3` can include shares to allow
        marginal costs to depend on quantity.

        The ``prices`` variable should not be included in the formulation for :math:`X_3`, but it should be included in
        the formulation for :math:`X_1` or :math:`X_2` (or both). The ``absorb`` argument of :class:`Formulation` can be
        used to absorb fixed effects into :math:`X_1` and :math:`X_3`, but not :math:`X_2`. Characteristics in
        :math:`X_2` should generally be included in :math:`X_1`. The typical exception is characteristics that are
        collinear with fixed effects that have been absorbed into :math:`X_1`.

        By default, characteristics in :math:`X_1` that do not involve ``prices``, :math:`X_1^\text{ex}`, will be
        combined with excluded demand-side instruments (specified below) to create the full set of demand-side
        instruments, :math:`Z_D`. Any fixed effects absorbed into :math:`X_1` will also be absorbed into :math:`Z_D`.
        Similarly, characteristics in :math:`X_3` that do not involve ``shares``, :math:`X_3^\text{ex}`, will be
        combined with the excluded supply-side instruments to create :math:`Z_S`, and any fixed effects absorbed into
        :math:`X_3` will also be absorbed into :math:`Z_S`. The ``add_exogenous`` flag can be used to disable this
        behavior.

        .. warning::

           Characteristics that involve prices, :math:`p`, or shares, :math:`s`, should always be formulated with the
           ``prices`` and ``shares`` variables, respectively. If another name is used, :class:`Problem` will not
           understand that the characteristic is endogenous, so it will be erroneously included in :math:`Z_D` or
           :math:`Z_S`, and derivatives computed with respect to prices or shares will likely be wrong. For example, to
           include a :math:`p^2` characteristic, include ``I(prices**2)`` in a formula instead of manually constructing
           and including a ``prices_squared`` variable.

    product_data : `structured array-like`
        Each row corresponds to a product. Markets can have differing numbers of products. The following fields are
        required:

            - **market_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate products with markets.

            - **shares** : (`numeric`) - Market shares, :math:`s`, which should be between zero and one, exclusive.
              Outside shares should also be between zero and one. Shares in each market should sum to less than one.

            - **prices** : (`numeric`) - Product prices, :math:`p`.

        If a formulation for :math:`X_3` is specified in ``product_formulations``, firm IDs are also required, since
        they will be used to estimate the supply side of the problem:

            - **firm_ids** : (`object, optional`) - IDs that associate products with firms.

        Excluded instruments are typically specified with the following fields:

            - **demand_instruments** : (`numeric`) - Excluded demand-side instruments, which, together with the
              formulated exogenous demand-side linear product characteristics, :math:`X_1^\text{ex}`, constitute the
              full set of  demand-side instruments, :math:`Z_D`. To instead specify the full matrix :math:`Z_D`, set
              ``add_exogenous`` to ``False``.

            - **supply_instruments** : (`numeric, optional`) - Excluded supply-side instruments, which, together with
              the formulated exogenous supply-side characteristics, :math:`X_3^\text{ex}`, constitute the full set of
              supply-side instruments, :math:`Z_S`. To instead specify the full matrix :math:`Z_S`, set
              ``add_exogenous`` to ``False``.

            - **covariance_instruments** : (`numeric, optional`) - Covariance instruments :math:`Z_C`. If specified,
              additional moments :math:`E[g_{C,jt}] = E[\xi_{jt}\omega_{jt}Z_{C,jt}] = 0` will be added, as in
              :ref:`references:MacKay and Miller (2025)`. The default 2SLS weighting matrix will have an additional
              :math:`(Z_C'Z_C / N)^{-1}` block after the first two.

              .. note::

                 Using covariance restrictions to identify a parameter on price can sometimes yield two solutions, where
                 the "upper" solution may be positive (i.e., implying upward-sloping demand). See
                 :ref:`references:MacKay and Miller (2025)` for more discussion of this point. In these cases when the
                 "lower" root is the correct solution, consider imposing a one-sided bound (e.g., zero) on the parameter
                 on price to ensure the appropriate sign using ``beta_bounds`` (if the parameter is in ``beta``) or
                 replacing it with a lognormal coefficient on price via the ``rc_type`` argument to :class:`Problem`.

              .. note::

                 In the current implementation, these covariance restrictions only affect the nonlinear parameters. The
                 linear parameters are estimated using other moments. In the case of overidentification, the estimator
                 may not be fully efficient because of this implementation decision.

        If ``firm_ids`` are specified, custom ownership matrices can be specified as well:

            - **ownership** : (`numeric, optional`) - Custom stacked :math:`J_t \times J_t` ownership or product
              holding matrices, :math:`\mathscr{H}`, for each market :math:`t`, which can be built with
              :func:`build_ownership`. By default, standard ownership matrices are built only when they are needed to
              reduce memory usage. If specified, there should be as many columns as there are products in the market
              with the most products. Rightmost columns in markets with fewer products will be ignored.

        .. note::

           Fields that can have multiple columns (``demand_instruments``, ``supply_instruments``, and ``ownership``) can
           either be matrices or can be broken up into multiple one-dimensional fields with column index suffixes that
           start at zero. For example, if there are three columns of excluded demand-side instruments, a
           ``demand_instruments`` field with three columns can be replaced by three one-dimensional fields:
           ``demand_instruments0``, ``demand_instruments1``, and ``demand_instruments2``.

        To estimate a nested logit or random coefficients nested logit (RCNL) model, nesting groups must be specified:

            - **nesting_ids** (`object, optional`) - IDs that associate products with nesting groups. When these IDs are
              specified, ``rho`` must be specified in :meth:`Problem.solve` as well.

        It may be convenient to define IDs for different products:

            - **product_ids** (`object, optional`) - IDs that identify products within markets. There can be multiple
              columns.

        To estimate unobservable autocorrelation with ``phi`` in :meth:`Problem.solve`, indices that define lags of the
        data must be specified:

            - **lag_indices** : (`int, optional`) - Indices that take on values from :math:`0` to :math:`N - 1`, which
              define the lag operator :math:`L` on the data. For example, if markets :math:`t` are simply time periods
              and the identity of products :math:`j` are persistent across periods, then :math:`L x_{jt} = x_{j,t-1}`.

              The value of the current row index indicates that this is the initial period for a product. Otherwise, the
              value should correspond to the row that is the lagged version of the current row.

        Finally, clustering groups can be specified to account for within-group correlation while updating the weighting
        matrix and estimating standard errors:

            - **clustering_ids** (`object, optional`) - Cluster group IDs, which will be used if ``W_type`` or
              ``se_type`` in :meth:`Problem.solve` is ``'clustered'``.

        Along with ``market_ids``, ``firm_ids``, ``nesting_ids``, ``product_ids``, ``clustering_ids``, and ``prices``,
        the names of any additional fields can typically be used as variables in ``product_formulations``. However,
        there are a few variable names such as ``'X1'``, which are reserved for use by :class:`Products`.

    agent_formulation : `Formulation, optional`
        :class:`Formulation` configuration for the matrix of observed agent characteristics called demographics,
        :math:`d`, which will only be included in the model if this formulation is specified. Since demographics are
        only used if there are demand-side nonlinear product characteristics, this formulation should only be specified
        if :math:`X_2` is formulated in ``product_formulations``. Variable names should correspond to fields in
        ``agent_data``. See the information under ``agent_data`` for how to give fields for product-specific
        demographics :math:`d_{ijt}`.

    agent_data : `structured array-like, optional`
        Each row corresponds to an agent. Markets can have differing numbers of agents. Since simulated agents are only
        used if there are demand-side nonlinear product characteristics, agent data should only be specified if
        :math:`X_2` is formulated in ``product_formulations``. If agent data are specified, market IDs are required:

            - **market_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate agents with markets. The set of distinct IDs should be
              the same as the set in ``product_data``. If ``integration`` is specified, there must be at least as many
              rows in each market as the number of nodes and weights that are built for the market.

        If ``integration`` is not specified, the following fields are required:

            - **weights** : (`numeric, optional`) - Integration weights, :math:`w`, for integration over agent choice
              probabilities.

            - **nodes** : (`numeric, optional`) - Unobserved agent characteristics called integration nodes,
              :math:`\nu`. If there are more than :math:`K_2` columns (the number of demand-side nonlinear product
              characteristics), only the first :math:`K_2` will be retained. If any columns of ``sigma`` in
              :meth:`Problem.solve` are fixed at zero, only the first few columns of these nodes will be used.

        The convenience function :func:`build_integration` can be useful when constructing custom nodes and weights.

        .. note::

           If ``nodes`` has multiple columns, it can be specified as a matrix or broken up into multiple one-dimensional
           fields with column index suffixes that start at zero. For example, if there are three columns of nodes, a
           ``nodes`` field with three columns can be replaced by three one-dimensional fields: ``nodes0``, ``nodes1``,
           and ``nodes2``.

        It may be convenient to define IDs for different agents:

            - **agent_ids** (`object, optional`) - IDs that identify agents within markets. There can be multiple of the
              same ID within a market.

        Along with ``market_ids`` and ``agent_ids``, the names of any additional fields can be typically be used as
        variables in ``agent_formulation``. Exceptions are the names ``'demographics'`` and ``'availability'``, which
        are reserved for use by :class:`Agents`.

        In addition to standard demographic variables :math:`d_{it}`, it is also possible to specify product-specific
        demographics :math:`d_{ijt}`. A typical example is geographic distance of agent :math:`i` from product
        :math:`j`. If ``agent_formulation`` has, for example, ``'distance'``, instead of including a single
        ``'distance'`` field in ``agent_data``, one should instead include ``'distance0'``, ``'distance1'``,
        ``'distance2'`` and so on, where the index corresponds to the order in which products appear within market in
        ``product_data``. For example, ``'distance5'`` should measure the distance of agents to the fifth product within
        the market, as ordered in ``product_data``. The last index should be the number of products in the largest
        market, minus one. For markets with fewer products than this maximum number, latter columns will be ignored.

        Finally, by default each agent :math:`i` in market :math:`t` is faced with the same choice set of product
        :math:`j`, but it is possible to specify agent-specific availability :math:`a_{ijt}` much in the same way that
        product-specific demographics are specified. To do so, the following field can be specified:

            - **availability** : (`numeric, optional`) - Agent-specific product availability, :math:`a`. Choice
              probabilities in :eq:`probabilities` are modified according to

              .. math:: s_{ijt} = \frac{a_{ijt} \exp V_{ijt}}{1 + \sum_{k \in J_t} a_{ijt} \exp V_{ikt}},

              and similarly for the nested logit model and consumer surplus calculations. By default, all
              :math:`a_{ijt} = 1`. To have a product :math:`j` be unavailable to agent :math:`i`, set
              :math:`a_{ijt} = 0`.

              Agent-specific availability is specified in the same way that product-specific demographics are specified.
              In ``agent_data``, one can include ``'availability0'``, ``'availability1'``, ``'availability2'``, and so
              on, where the index corresponds to the order in which products appear within market in ``product_data``.
              The last index should be the number of products in the largest market, minus one. For markets with fewer
              products than this maximum number, latter columns will be ignored.

    integration : `Integration, optional`
        :class:`Integration` configuration for how to build nodes and weights for integration over agent choice
        probabilities, which will replace any ``nodes`` and ``weights`` fields in ``agent_data``. This configuration is
        required if ``nodes`` and ``weights`` in ``agent_data`` are not specified. It should not be specified if
        :math:`X_2` is not formulated in ``product_formulations``.

        If this configuration is specified, :math:`K_2` columns of nodes (the number of demand-side nonlinear product
        characteristics) will be built. However, if ``sigma`` in :meth:`Problem.solve` is left unspecified or
        specified with columns fixed at zero, fewer columns will be used.

    rc_types : `sequence of str, optional`
        Random coefficient types:

            - ``'linear'`` (default) - The random coefficient is as defined in :eq:`mu`. All elliptical distributions
              are supported, including the normal distribution.

            - ``'log'`` - The random coefficient's column in :eq:`mu` is exponentiated before being pre-multiplied by
              :math:`X_2`. It will take on values bounded from below by zero. All log-elliptical distributions are
              supported, including the lognormal distribution.

            - ``'logit'`` - The random coefficient's column in :eq:`mu` is passed through the inverse logit function
              before being pre-multiplied by :math:`X_2`. It will take on values bounded from below by zero and above by
              one.

        The list should have as many strings as there are columns in :math:`X_2`. Each string determines the type of the
        random coefficient on the corresponding product characteristic in :math:`X_2`.

        A typical example of when to use ``'log'`` is to have a lognormal coefficient on prices. Implementing this
        typically involves having an ``I(-prices)`` in the formulation for :math:`X_2`, and instead of including
        ``prices`` in :math:`X_1`, including a ``1`` in the ``agent_formulation``. Then the corresponding coefficient in
        :math:`\Pi` will serve as the mean parameter for the lognormal random coefficient on negative
        prices, :math:`-p_{jt}`.

    epsilon_scale : `float, optional`
        Factor by which the Type I Extreme Value idiosyncratic preference term, :math:`\epsilon_{ijt}`, is scaled. By
        default, :math:`\epsilon_{ijt}` is not scaled. The typical use of this parameter is to approximate the pure
        characteristics model of :ref:`references:Berry and Pakes (2007)` by choosing a value smaller than ``1.0``. As
        this scaling factor approaches zero, the model approaches the pure characteristics model in which there is no
        idiosyncratic preference term.

        In practice, this is implemented by dividing :math:`V_{ijt} = \delta_{jt} + \mu_{ijt}` by the scaling factor
        when solving for the mean utility :math:`\delta_{jt}`. For small scaling factors, this leads to large values
        of :math:`V_{ijt}`, which when exponentiated in the logit expression can lead to overflow issues discussed in
        :ref:`references:Berry and Pakes (2007)`. The safe versions of the contraction mapping discussed in the
        documentation for ``fp_type`` in :meth:`Problem.solve` (which is used by default) eliminate overflow issues at
        the cost of introducing fewer (but still common for a small scaling factor) underflow issues. Throughout the
        contraction mapping, some values of the simulated shares :math:`s_{jt}(\delta, \theta)` can underflow to zero,
        causing the contraction to fail when taking logs. By default, ``shares_bounds`` in :meth:`Problem.solve` bounds
        these simulated shares from below by ``1e-300``, which eliminates these underflow issues at the cost of making
        it more difficult for iteration routines to converge.

        With this in mind, scaling epsilon is not supported for nonlinear contractions, and is also not supported when
        there are nesting groups, since these further complicate the problem. In practice, if the goal is to approximate
        the pure characteristics model, it is a good idea to slowly decrease the scale of epsilon (e.g., starting with
        ``0.5``, trying ``0.1``, etc.) until the contraction begins to fail. To further decrease the scale, there are a
        few things that can help. One is passing a different :class:`Iteration` configuration to ``iteration`` in
        :meth:`Problem.solve`, such as ``'lm'``, which can be robust in this situation. Another is to set
        ``pyblp.options.dtype = np.longdouble`` when on a system that supports extended precision (see
        :mod:`~pyblp.options` for more information about this) and choose a smaller lower bound by configuring
        ``shares_bounds`` in :meth:`Problem.solve`. Ultimately the model will stop being solvable at a certain point,
        and this point will vary by problem, so approximating the pure characteristics model requires some degree of
        experimentation.

    costs_type : `str, optional`
        Functional form of the marginal cost function :math:`\tilde{c} = f(c)` in :eq:`costs`. The following
        specifications are supported:

            - ``'linear'`` (default) - Linear specification: :math:`\tilde{c} = c`.

            - ``'log'`` - Log-linear specification: :math:`\tilde{c} = \log c`.

        This specification is only relevant if :math:`X_3` is formulated.

    add_exogenous : `bool, optional`
        Whether to add characteristics in :math:`X_1` that do not involve prices, :math:`X_1^\text{ex}`, to the
        ``demand_instruments`` field in ``product_data`` (including absorbed fixed effects), and similarly, whether
        to add characteristics in :math:`X_3` that do not involve shares, :math:`X_3^\text{ex}`, to the
        ``supply_instruments`` field. This is by default ``True`` so that only excluded instruments need to be
        specified.

        If this is set to ``False``, ``demand_instruments`` and ``supply_instruments`` should specify the full sets of
        demand- and supply-side instruments, :math:`Z_D` and :math:`Z_S`, and fixed effects should be manually absorbed
        (for example, with the :func:`build_matrix` function). This behavior can be useful, for example, when price is
        not the only endogenous product characteristic over which consumers have preferences. This model could be
        correctly estimated by manually adding the truly exogenous characteristics in :math:`X_1` to :math:`Z_D`.

        .. warning::

           If this flag is set to ``False`` because there are multiple endogenous product characteristics, care should
           be taken when including a supply side or computing optimal instruments. These routines assume that price is
           the only endogenous variable over which consumers have preferences.
