class Simulation(Economy):
    r"""Simulation of data in BLP-type models.

    Any data left unspecified are simulated during initialization. Simulated prices and shares can be replaced by
    :meth:`Simulation.replace_endogenous` with equilibrium values that are consistent with true parameters. Less
    commonly, simulated exogenous variables can be replaced instead by :meth:`Simulation.replace_exogenous`. To choose
    your own prices, refer to the first note in :meth:`Simulation.replace_endogenous`. Simulations
    are typically used for two purposes:

        1. Solving for equilibrium prices and shares under more complicated counterfactuals than is possible with
           :meth:`ProblemResults.compute_prices` and :meth:`ProblemResults.compute_shares`. For example, this class
           can be initialized with estimated parameters, structural errors, and marginal costs from a
           :meth:`ProblemResults`, but with changed data (fewer products, new products, different characteristics, etc.)
           and :meth:`Simulation.replace_endogenous` can be used to compute the corresponding prices and shares.

        2. Simulation of BLP-type models from scratch. For example, a model with fixed true parameters can be simulated
           many times, converted into problems with :meth:`SimulationResults.to_problem`, and solved with
           :meth:`Problem.solve` to evaluate in a Monte Carlo study how well the true parameters can be recovered.

    If data for variables (used to formulate product characteristics in :math:`X_1`, :math:`X_2`, and :math:`X_3`, as
    well as agent demographics, :math:`d`, and endogenous prices and market shares :math:`p` and :math:`s`) are not
    provided, the values for each unspecified variable are drawn independently from the standard uniform distribution.
    In each market :math:`t`, market shares are divided by the number of products in the market :math:`J_t`. Typically,
    :meth:`Simulation.replace_endogenous` is used to replace prices and shares with equilibrium values that are
    consistent with true parameters.

    If data for unobserved demand-and supply-side product characteristics, :math:`\xi` and :math:`\omega`, are not
    provided, they are by default drawn from a mean-zero bivariate normal distribution.

    After variables are loaded or simulated, any unspecified integration nodes and weights, :math:`\nu` and :math:`w`,
    are constructed according to a specified :class:`Integration` configuration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    product_formulations : `Formulation or sequence of Formulation`
        :class:`Formulation` configuration or a sequence of up to three :class:`Formulation` configurations for the
        matrix of demand-side linear product characteristics, :math:`X_1`, for the matrix of demand-side nonlinear
        product characteristics, :math:`X_2`, and for the matrix of supply-side characteristics, :math:`X_3`,
        respectively. If the formulation for :math:`X_2` is not specified or is ``None``, the logit (or nested logit)
        model will be simulated.

        The ``shares`` variable should not be included in the formulations for :math:`X_1` or :math:`X_2`. If ``shares``
        is included in the formulation for :math:`X_3` and ``product_data`` does not include ``shares``, one will likely
        want to set ``constant_costs=False`` in :meth:`Simulation.replace_endogenous`.

        The ``prices`` variable should not be included in the formulation for :math:`X_3`, but it should be included in
        the formulation for :math:`X_1` or :math:`X_2` (or both). Variables that cannot be loaded from ``product_data``
        will be drawn from independent standard uniform distributions. Unlike in :class:`Problem`, fixed effect
        absorption is not supported during simulation.

        .. warning::

           Characteristics that involve prices, :math:`p`, or shares, :math:`s`, should always be formulated with the
           ``prices`` and ``shares`` variables, respectively. If another name is used, :class:`Simulation` will not
           understand that the characteristic is endogenous. For example, to include a :math:`p^2` characteristic,
           include ``I(prices**2)`` in a formula instead of manually constructing and including a ``prices_squared``
           variable.

    product_data : `structured array-like`
        Each row corresponds to a product. Markets can have differing numbers of products. The convenience function
        :func:`build_id_data` can be used to construct the following required ID data:

            - **market_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate products with markets.

            - **firm_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate products with firms.

        Custom ownership matrices can be specified as well:

            - **ownership** : (`numeric, optional`) - Custom stacked :math:`J_t \times J_t` ownership or product holding
              matrices, :math:`\mathscr{H}`, for each market :math:`t`, which can be built with :func:`build_ownership`.
              By default, standard ownership matrices are built only when they are needed to reduce memory usage. If
              specified, there should be as many columns as there are products in the market with the most products.
              Rightmost columns in markets with fewer products will be ignored.

        .. note::

           The ``ownership`` field can either be a matrix or can be broken up into multiple one-dimensional fields with
           column index suffixes that start at zero. For example, if there are three products in each market, a
           ``ownership`` field with three columns can be replaced by three one-dimensional fields: ``ownership0``,
           ``ownership1``, and ``ownership2``.

        To simulate a nested logit or random coefficients nested logit (RCNL) model, nesting groups must be specified:

            - **nesting_ids** (`object, optional`) - IDs that associate products with nesting groups. When these IDs are
              specified, ``rho`` must be specified as well.

        It may be convenient to define IDs for different products:

            - **product_ids** (`object, optional`) - IDs that identify products within markets. There can be multiple
              columns.

        To specify unobservable autocorrelation with ``phi``, indices that define lags of the data must be specified:

            - **lag_indices** : (`int, optional`) - Indices that take on values from :math:`0` to :math:`N - 1`, which
              define the lag operator :math:`L` on the data. For example, if markets :math:`t` are simply time periods
              and the identity of products :math:`j` are persistent across periods, then :math:`L x_{jt} = x_{j,t-1}`.

              The value of the current row index indicates that this is the initial period for a product. Otherwise, the
              value should correspond to the row that is the lagged version of the current row.

        Along with ``market_ids``, ``firm_ids``, ``product_ids``, and ``nesting_ids``, the names of any additional
        fields can typically be used as variables in ``product_formulations``. However, there are a few variable names
        such as ``'X1'``, which are reserved for use by :class:`Products`.

    beta : `array-like`
        Vector of demand-side linear parameters, :math:`\beta`. Elements correspond to columns in :math:`X_1`, which
        is formulated by ``product_formulations``.
    sigma : `array-like, optional`
        Lower-triangular Cholesky root of the covariance matrix for unobserved taste heterogeneity, :math:`\Sigma`. Rows
        and columns correspond to columns in :math:`X_2`, which is formulated by ``product_formulations``. If
        :math:`X_2` is not formulated, this should not be specified, since the logit model will be simulated.
    pi : `array-like, optional`
        Parameters that measure how agent tastes vary with demographics, :math:`\Pi`. Rows correspond to the same
        product characteristics as in ``sigma``. Columns correspond to columns in :math:`d`, which is formulated by
        ``agent_formulation``. If :math:`d` is not formulated, this should not be specified.
    gamma : `array-like, optional`
        Vector of supply-side linear parameters, :math:`\gamma`. Elements correspond to columns in :math:`X_3`, which
        is formulated by ``product_formulations``. If :math:`X_3` is not formulated, this should not be specified.
    rho : `array-like, optional`
        Parameters that measure within nesting group correlation, :math:`\rho`. If this is a scalar, it corresponds to
        all groups defined by the ``nesting_ids`` field of ``product_data``. If this is a vector, it must have :math:`H`
        elements, one for each nesting group. Elements correspond to group IDs in the sorted order of
        :attr:`Simulation.unique_nesting_ids`. If nesting IDs are not specified, this should not be specified either.
    phi : `float, optional`
        Parameters measuring unobservable autocorrelation, :math:`\phi = [\phi_\xi, \phi_\omega]'`, which must be
        specified if ``lag_indices`` in ``product_data`` are specified. This is ignored during simulation if ``xi`` and
        ``omega'' are specified. Otherwise, if specified, unobservables are drawn according to AR(1) processes:

            .. math::
               :eq: simulated_ar1

               \xi_{jt} = \phi_\xi \cdot L \xi_{jt} + \Delta_{\phi_\xi} \xi_{jt},
               \omega_{jt} = \phi_\omega \cdot L \omega_{jt} + \Delta_{\phi_\omega} \omega_{jt},

        where the ``lag_indices`` field in ``product_data`` defines the lag operator :math:`L`.

    agent_formulation : `Formulation, optional`
        :class:`Formulation` configuration for the matrix of observed agent characteristics called demographics,
        :math:`d`, which will only be included in the model if this formulation is specified. Any variables that cannot
        be loaded from ``agent_data`` will be drawn from independent standard uniform distributions.
    agent_data : `structured array-like, optional`
        Each row corresponds to an agent. Markets can have differing numbers of agents. Since simulated agents are only
        used if there are demand-side nonlinear product characteristics, agent data should only be specified if
        :math:`X_2` is formulated in ``product_formulations``. If agent data are specified, market IDs are required:

            - **market_ids** : (`object, optional`) - IDs that associate agents with markets. The set of distinct IDs
              should be the same as the set in ``product_data``. If ``integration`` is specified, there must be at least
              as many rows in each market as the number of nodes and weights that are built for the market.

        If ``integration`` is not specified, the following fields are required:

            - **weights** : (`numeric, optional`) - Integration weights, :math:`w`, for integration over agent choice
              probabilities.

            - **nodes** : (`numeric, optional`) - Unobserved agent characteristics called integration nodes,
              :math:`\nu`. If there are more than :math:`K_2` columns (the number of demand-side nonlinear product
              characteristics), only the first :math:`K_2` will be used. If any columns of ``sigma`` are fixed at zero,
              only the first few columns of these nodes will be used.

        The convenience function :func:`build_integration` can be useful when constructing custom nodes and weights.

        .. note::

           If ``nodes`` has multiple columns, it can be specified as a matrix or broken up into multiple one-dimensional
           fields with column index suffixes that start at zero. For example, if there are three columns of nodes, a
           ``nodes`` field with three columns can be replaced by three one-dimensional fields: ``nodes0``, ``nodes1``,
           and ``nodes2``.

        It may be convenient to define IDs for different agents:

            - **agent_ids** (`object, optional`) - IDs that identify agents within markets. There can be multiple of the
              same ID within a market.

        Along with ``market_ids`` and ``agent_ids``, the names of any additional fields can typically be used as
        variables in ``agent_formulation``. The exception is the name ``'demographics'``, which is reserved for use by
        :class:`Agents`.

        In addition to standard demographic variables :math:`d_{it}`, it is also possible to specify product-specific
        demographics :math:`d_{ijt}`. A typical example is geographic distance of agent :math:`i` from product
        :math:`j`. If ``agent_formulation`` has, for example, ``'distance'``, instead of including a single
        ``'distance'`` field in ``agent_data``, one should instead include ``'distance0'``, ``'distance1'``,
        ``'distance2'`` and so on, where the index corresponds to the order in which products appear within market in
        ``product_data``. For example, ``'distance5'`` should measure the distance of agents to the fifth product within
        the market, as ordered in ``product_data``. The last index should be the number of products in the largest
        market, minus one. For markets with fewer products than this maximum number, latter columns will be ignored.

        Finally, by default each agent :math:`i` in market :math:`t` is faced with the same choice set of product
        :math:`j`, but it is possible to specify agent-specific availability :math:`a_{ijt}` much in the same way that
        product-specific demographics are specified. To do so, the following field can be specified:

            - **availability** : (`numeric, optional`) - Agent-specific product availability, :math:`a`. Choice
              probabilities in :eq:`probabilities` are modified according to

              .. math:: s_{ijt} = \frac{a_{ijt} \exp V_{ijt}}{1 + \sum_{k \in J_t} a_{ijt} \exp V_{ikt}},

              and similarly for the nested logit model and consumer surplus calculations. By default, all
              :math:`a_{ijt} = 1`. To have a product :math:`j` be unavailable to agent :math:`i`, set
              :math:`a_{ijt} = 0`.

              Agent-specific availability is specified in the same way that product-specific demographics are specified.
              In ``agent_data``, one can include ``'availability0'``, ``'availability1'``, ``'availability2'``, and so
              on, where the index corresponds to the order in which products appear within market in ``product_data``.
              The last index should be the number of products in the largest market, minus one. For markets with fewer
              products than this maximum number, latter columns will be ignored.

    integration : `Integration, optional`
        :class:`Integration` configuration for how to build nodes and weights for integration over agent choice
        probabilities, which will replace any ``nodes`` and ``weights`` fields in ``agent_data``. This configuration is
        required if ``nodes`` and ``weights`` in ``agent_data`` are not specified. It should not be specified if
        :math:`X_2` is not formulated in ``product_formulations``.

        If this configuration is specified, :math:`K_2` columns of nodes (the number of demand-side nonlinear product
        characteristics) will be built. However, if ``sigma`` is left unspecified or is specified with columns fixed at
        zero, fewer columns will be used.

    xi : `array-like, optional`
        Demand-side unobservable, :math:`\xi`. This must be specified if :math:`X_3` is not formulated or if ``omega``
        is specified.

        By default, if :math:`X_3` is formulated, this and :math:`\omega_{jt}` are drawn from a mean-zero bivariate
        normal distribution. If ``phi`` is specified, then innovations :math:`\Delta_{\phi_\xi} \xi_{jt}` and
        :math:`\Delta_{\phi_\omega} \omega_{jt}` in :eq:`simulated_ar` are drawn instead, and initial values are scaled
        by :math:`1 - \phi_\xi^2` and :math:`1 - \phi_\omega^2` to be draws from their stationary distribution.

    omega : `array-like, optional`
        Supply-side unobservable, :math:`\omega`. This must be specified if :math:`X_3` is formulated and ``xi`` is
        specified. It is ignored if :math:`X_3` is not formulated.

        By default, if :math:`X_3` is formulated, this and :math:`\xi_{jt}` are drawn from a mean-zero bivariate normal
        distribution. If ``phi`` is specified, then innovations are drawn instead, as described for ``xi``.

    xi_variance : `float, optional`
        Variance of :math:`\xi_{jt}` (or its innovation if ``phi`` is specified). The default value is ``1.0``. This is
        ignored if ``xi`` or ``omega`` is specified.
    omega_variance : `float, optional`
        Variance of :math:`\omega_{jt}` (or its innovation if ``phi`` is specified). The default value is ``1.0``. This
        is ignored if ``xi`` or ``omega`` is specified.
    correlation : `float, optional`
        Correlation between :math:`\xi_{jt}` and :math:`\omega_{jt}` (or their innovations if ``phi`` is specified).
        The default value is ``0.9``. This is ignored if ``xi`` or ``omega`` is specified.
    rc_types : `sequence of str, optional`
        Random coefficient types:

            - ``'linear'`` (default) - The random coefficient is as defined in :eq:`mu`.

            - ``'log'`` - The random coefficient's column in :eq:`mu` is exponentiated before being pre-multiplied by
              :math:`X_2`. It will take on values bounded from below by zero.

            - ``'logit'`` - The random coefficient's column in :eq:`mu` is passed through the inverse logit function
              before being pre-multiplied by :math:`X_2`. It will take on values bounded from below by zero and above by
              one.

        The list should have as many strings as there are columns in :math:`X_2`. Each string determines the type of the
        random coefficient on the corresponding product characteristic in :math:`X_2`.

        A typical example of when to use ``'log'`` is to have a lognormal coefficient on prices. Implementing this
        typically involves having an ``I(-prices)`` in the formulation for :math:`X_2`, and instead of including
        ``prices`` in :math:`X_1`, including a ``1`` in the ``agent_formulation``. Then the corresponding coefficient in
        :math:`\Pi` will serve as the mean parameter for the lognormal random coefficient on negative
        prices, :math:`-p_{jt}`.

    epsilon_scale : `float, optional`
        Factor by which the Type I Extreme Value idiosyncratic preference term, :math:`\epsilon_{ijt}`, is scaled. By
        default, :math:`\epsilon_{ijt}` is not scaled. The typical use of this parameter is to approximate the pure
        characteristics model of :ref:`references:Berry and Pakes (2007)` by choosing a value smaller than ``1.0``. As
        this scaling factor approaches zero, the model approaches the pure characteristics model in which there is no
        idiosyncratic preference term.

        For more information about choosing this parameter and estimating models where it is smaller than ``1.0``, refer
        to the same argument in :meth:`Problem.solve`. In some situations, it may be easier to solve simulations with
        small epsilon scaling factors by using :meth:`Simulation.replace_exogenous` rather than
        :meth:`Simulation.replace_endogenous`.

    costs_type : `str, optional`
        Specification of the marginal cost function :math:`\tilde{c} = f(c)` in :eq:`costs`. The following
        specifications are supported:

            - ``'linear'`` (default) - Linear specification: :math:`\tilde{c} = c`.

            - ``'log'`` - Log-linear specification: :math:`\tilde{c} = \log c`.

    seed : `int, optional`
        Passed to :class:`numpy.random.RandomState` to seed the random number generator before data are simulated. By
        default, a seed is not passed to the random number generator.

        r"""Replace simulated prices and market shares with equilibrium values that are consistent with true parameters.

        This method is the standard way of solving the simulation. Prices and market shares are computed in each market
        by iterating over the :math:`\zeta`-markup contraction in :eq:`zeta_contraction`:

        .. math:: p \leftarrow c + \zeta(p).

        .. note::

           To not replace prices, pass the desired prices to ``prices`` and use an :class:`Iteration` configuration with
           ``method='return'``. This just uses the iteration "routine" that simply returns the the starting values,
           which are ``prices``.

           Using this same fake iteration routine and not setting prices will result in a simulation under perfect
           (instead of Bertrand) competition because the default starting values for the iteration routine are marginal
           costs.

        .. note::

           This method supports :func:`parallel` processing. If multiprocessing is used, market-by-market computation of
           prices and shares will be distributed among the processes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        costs : `array-like, optional`
            Marginal costs, :math:`c`. By default, :math:`c = X_3\gamma + \omega` if ``costs_type`` was ``'linear'`` in
            :class:`Simulation` (the default), and the exponential of this if it was ``'log'``. Marginal costs must be
            specified if :math:`X_3` was not formulated in :class:`Simulation`. If marginal costs depend on prices
            through market shares, they will be updated to reflect different prices during each iteration of the
            routine.
        prices : `array-like, optional`
            Prices at which the fixed point iteration routine will start. By default, ``costs``, are used as starting
            values.
        iteration : `Iteration, optional`
            :class:`Iteration` configuration for how to solve the fixed point problem. By default,
            ``Iteration('simple', {'atol': 1e-12})`` is used.
        constant_costs : `bool, optional`
            Whether to assume that marginal costs, :math:`c`, remain constant as equilibrium prices and shares change.
            By default this is ``True``, which means that firms treat marginal costs as constant (equal to ``costs``)
            when setting prices. If set to ``False``, marginal costs will be allowed to adjust if ``shares`` was
            included in the formulation for :math:`X_3`. When simulating fake data, it likely makes more sense to set
            this to ``False`` since otherwise arbitrary ``shares`` simulated by :class:`Simulation` will be used in
            marginal costs.
        compute_gradients : `bool, optional`
            Whether to compute profit gradients to verify first order conditions. This is by default ``True``. Setting
            it to ``False`` will slightly speed up computation, but first order conditions will not be reported.
        compute_hessians : `bool, optional`
            Whether to compute profit Hessians to verify second order conditions. This is by default ``True``. Setting
            it to ``False`` will slightly speed up computation, but second order conditions will not be reported.
        error_behavior : `str, optional`
            How to handle errors when computing prices and shares. For example, the fixed point routine may not converge
            if the effects of nonlinear parameters on price overwhelm the linear parameter on price, which should be
            sufficiently negative. The following behaviors are supported:

                - ``'raise'`` (default) - Raise an exception.

                - ``'warn'`` - Use the last computed prices and shares. If the fixed point routine fails to converge,
                  these are the last prices and shares computed by the routine. If there are other issues, these are the
                  starting prices and their associated shares.

        Returns
        -------
        `SimulationResults`
            :class:`SimulationResults` of the solved simulation.

        r"""Replace exogenous product characteristics with values that are consistent with true parameters.

        This method implements a less common way of solving the simulation. It may be preferable to
        :meth:`Simulation.replace_endogenous` when for some reason it is desirable to retain the prices and market
        shares from :class:`Simulation`, which are assumed to be in equilibrium. For example, it can be helpful when
        approximating the pure characteristics model of :ref:`references:Berry and Pakes (2007)` by setting a small
        ``epsilon_scale`` value in :class:`Simulation`.

        For this method of solving the simulation to be used, there must be an exogenous product characteristic
        :math:`v` that shows up only in :math:`X_1^\text{ex}`, and if there is a supply side, another product
        characteristic :math:`w` that shows up only in :math:`X_3^\text{ex}`. These characteristics will be replaced
        with values that are consistent with true parameters.

        First, the mean utility :math:`\delta` is computed in each market by iterating over the contraction in
        :eq:`contraction` and :math:`(\delta - \xi - X_1 \beta)\beta_v^{-1}` is added to the :math:`v` from
        :class:`Simulation`. Here, :math:`\beta_v` is the linear parameter in :math:`\beta` on :math:`v`.

        With a supply side, the marginal cost function :math:`\tilde{c}` is computed according to :eq:`eta` and
        :eq:`costs` and :math:`(\tilde{c} - \omega - X_3 \gamma)\gamma_w^{-1}` is added to the :math:`w` from
        :class:`Simulation`. Here, :math:`\gamma_w` is the linear parameter in :math:`\gamma` on :math:`w`.

        .. note::

           This method supports :func:`parallel` processing. If multiprocessing is used, market-by-market computation of
           prices and shares will be distributed among the processes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X1_name : `str`
            The name of the variable :math:`v` in :math:`X_1^\text{ex}` that will be replaced. It should show up only
            once in the formulation for :math:`X_1` from :class:`Simulation` and it should not be transformed in any
            way.
        X3_name : `str, optional`
            The name of the variable :math:`w` in :math:`X_3^\text{ex}` that will be replaced. It should show up only
            once in the formulation for :math:`X_3` from :class:`Simulation` and it should not be transformed in any
            way. This will only be used if there is a supply side.
        delta : `array-like, optional`
            Initial values for the mean utility, :math:`\delta`, which the fixed point iteration routine will start
            at. By default, the solution to the logit model in :eq:`logit_delta` is used. If there is a nesting
            structure, solution to the nested logit model in :eq:`nested_logit_delta` under the initial ``rho`` is used
            instead.
        iteration : `Iteration, optional`
            :class:`Iteration` configuration for how to solve the fixed point problem used to compute
            :math:`\delta` in each market. This configuration is only relevant if there are nonlinear parameters, since
            :math:`\delta` can be estimated analytically in the logit model. By default,
            ``Iteration('squarem', {'atol': 1e-14})`` is used. For more information, refer to the same argument in
            :meth:`Problem.solve`.
        fp_type : `str, optional`
            Configuration for the type of contraction mapping used to compute :math:`\delta`. For information about
            the different types, refer to the same argument in :meth:`Problem.solve`.
        shares_bounds : `tuple, optional`
            Configuration for :math:`s_{jt}(\delta, \theta)` bounds of the form ``(lb, ub)``, in which both ``lb`` and
            ``ub`` are floats or ``None``. By default, simulated shares are bounded from below by ``1e-300``. This is
            only relevant if ``fp_type`` is ``'safe_linear'`` or ``'linear'``. Bounding shares in the contraction does
            nothing with a nonlinear fixed point. For more information, refer to :meth:`Problem.solve`.
        error_behavior : `str, optional`
            How to handle errors when computing :math:`\delta` and :math:`\tilde{c}`. The following behaviors are
            supported:

                - ``'raise'`` (default) - Raise an exception.

                - ``'warn'`` - Use the last computed :math:`\delta` and :math:`\tilde{c}`. If the fixed point routine
                  fails to converge, these are the last :math:`\delta` and the associated :math:`\tilde{c}` by the
                  routine. If there are other issues, these are the starting :math:`\delta` values and their associated
                  :math:`\tilde{c}`.

        Returns
        -------
        `SimulationResults`
            :class:`SimulationResults` of the solved simulation.
