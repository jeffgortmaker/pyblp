def build_id_data(T: int, J: int, F: int) -> RecArray:
    r"""Build a balanced panel of market and firm IDs.

    This function can be used to build ``id_data`` for :class:`Simulation` initialization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : `int`
        Number of markets.
    J : `int`
        Number of products in each market.
    F : `int`
        Number of firms. If ``J`` is divisible by ``F``, firms produce ``J / F`` products in each market. Otherwise,
        firms with smaller IDs will produce excess products.

    Returns
    -------
    `recarray`
        IDs that associate products with markets and firms. Each of the ``T * J`` rows corresponds to a product. Fields:

            - **market_ids** : (`object`) - Market IDs that take on values from ``0`` to ``T - 1``.

            - **firm_ids** : (`object`) - Firm IDs that take on values from ``0`` to ``F - 1``.

def build_ownership(

    Ownership or product holding matrices are defined by their cooperation matrix counterparts, :math:`\kappa`. For each
    market :math:`t`, :math:`\mathscr{H}_{jk} = \kappa_{fg}` where :math:`j \in J_{ft}`, the set of products
    produced by firm :math:`f` in the market, and similarly, :math:`g \in J_{gt}`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    product_data : `structured array-like`
        Each row corresponds to a product. Markets can have differing numbers of products. The following fields are
        required (except for ``firm_ids`` when ``kappa_specification`` is one of the special cases):

            - **market_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate products with markets.

            - **firm_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate products with firms. This field is ignored if
              ``kappa_specification`` is one of the special cases and not a function.

    kappa_specification : `str or callable, optional`
        Specification for each market's cooperation matrix, :math:`\kappa`, which can either be a general function or a
        string that implements a special case. The general function is is of the following form::

            kappa(f, g) -> value

        where ``value`` is :math:`\mathscr{H}_{jk}` and both ``f`` and ``g`` are firm IDs from the ``firm_ids`` field of
        ``product_data``.

        The default specification, ``lambda: f, g: int(f == g)``, constructs traditional ownership matrices. That is,
        :math:`\kappa = I`, the identify matrix, implies that :math:`\mathscr{H}_{jk}` is :math:`1` if the same firm
        produces products :math:`j` and :math:`k`, and is :math:`0` otherwise.

        If ``firm_ids`` happen to be indices for an actual :math:`\kappa` matrix, ``lambda f, g: kappa[f, g]`` will
        build ownership matrices according to the matrix ``kappa``.

        When one of the special cases is specified, ``firm_ids`` in ``product_data`` are not required and if specified
        will be ignored:

            - ``'monopoly'`` - Monopoly ownership matrices are all ones: :math:`\mathscr{H}_{jk} = 1` for all :math:`j`
              and :math:`k`.

            - ``'single'`` - Single product firm ownership matrices are identity matrices: :math:`\mathscr{H}_{jk} = 1`
              if :math:`j = k` and :math:`0` otherwise.

    Returns
    -------
    `ndarray`
        Stacked :math:`J_t \times J_t` ownership matrices, :math:`\mathscr{H}`, for each market :math:`t`. If a market
        has fewer products than others, extra columns will contain ``numpy.nan``.

    third matrix that consists of sums over rival goods. Without optional interaction terms, all three matrices have the

    .. note::

       To construct simpler, firm-agnostic instruments that are sums over functions of differences between all different
       goods, specify a constant column of firm IDs and keep only the first half of the instrument columns.

    Let :math:`x_{jt\ell}` be characteristic :math:`\ell` in :math:`X` for product :math:`j` in market :math:`t`, which
    is produced by firm :math:`f`. That is, :math:`j \in J_{ft}`. Then in the "local" version of
    :math:`Z^\text{Diff}(X)`,

    .. math::
       :label: local_instruments

       Z_{jt\ell}^\text{Local,Other}(X) =

       Z_{jt\ell}^\text{Local,Rival}(X) =
       \sum_{k \notin J_{ft}} 1(|d_{jkt\ell}| < \text{SD}_\ell),

    where :math:`d_{jkt\ell} = x_{kt\ell} - x_{jt\ell}` is the difference between products :math:`j` and :math:`k` in
    terms of characteristic :math:`\ell`, :math:`\text{SD}_\ell` is the standard deviation of these pairwise differences
    computed across all markets, and :math:`1(|d_{jkt\ell}| < \text{SD}_\ell)` indicates that products :math:`j` and
    :math:`k` are close to each other in terms of characteristic :math:`\ell`.

    The intuition behind this "local" version is that demand for products is often most influenced by a small number of
    other goods that are very similar. For the "quadratic" version of :math:`Z^\text{Diff}(X)`, which uses a more
    continuous measure of the distance between goods,

    .. math::

       Z_{jtk}^\text{Quad,Rival}(X) = \sum_{k \notin J_{ft}} d_{jkt\ell}^2.

    With interaction terms, which reflect covariances between different characteristics, the summands for the "local"
    versions are :math:`1(|d_{jkt\ell}| < \text{SD}_\ell) \times d_{jkt\ell'}` for all characteristics :math:`\ell'`,
    and the summands for the "quadratic" versions are :math:`d_{jkt\ell} \times d_{jkt\ell'}` for all
    :math:`\ell' \geq \ell`.

       Usually, any supply or demand shifters are added to these excluded instruments, depending on whether they are
       meant to be used for demand- or supply-side estimation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    formulation : `Formulation`
        :class:`Formulation` configuration for :math:`X`, the matrix of product characteristics used to build excluded
        instruments. Variable names should correspond to fields in ``product_data``.

    version : `str, optional`

def build_integration(integration: Integration, dimensions: int) -> RecArray:
    r"""Build nodes and weights for integration over agent choice probabilities.

    This function can be used to build custom ``agent_data`` for :class:`Problem` initialization. Specifically, this
    function affords more flexibility than passing an :class:`Integration` configuration directly to :class:`Problem`.
    For example, if agents have unobserved tastes over only a subset of demand-side nonlinear product characteristics
    (i.e., if ``sigma`` in :meth:`Problem.solve` has columns of zeros), this function can be used to build agent data
    with fewer columns of integration nodes than the number of unobserved product characteristics, :math:`K_2`. This
    function can also be used to construct nodes that can be transformed into demographic variables.

    To build nodes and weights for multiple markets, this function can be called multiple times, once for each market.

    Parameters
    ----------
    integration : `Integration`
        :class:`Integration` configuration for how to build nodes and weights for integration.
    dimensions : `int`
        Number of dimensions over which to integrate, or equivalently, the number of columns of integration nodes.
        When an :class:`Integration` configuration is passed directly to :class:`Problem`, this is the number of
        demand-side nonlinear product characteristics, :math:`K_2`.

    Returns
    -------

    represent matrices, such as the :class:`pandas.DataFrame`.

    This function converts record arrays created by PyBLP into dictionaries that map field names to one-dimensional
    arrays. Matrices in the original record array (e.g., ``demand_instruments``) are split into as many fields as there
    are columns (e.g., ``demand_instruments0``, ``demand_instruments1``, and so on).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : `recarray`
        Record array created by PyBLP.
    ignore_empty : `bool, optional`
        Whether to ignore matrices with zero size. By default, these are ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    `dict`
        The data re-structured as a dictionary.
